Background on research question:  For our research project, we will be using a differences-in-differences methodology. The first step of this research method is to compare the area in which the metering policy was enacted with an area with similar or equal trends in which metering was not enacted. Therefore, we must find areas with comparable trends before the metering policy was enacted. In order to check the validity of potential comparison areas, we must graph the trends in apprehensions for three potential areas of comparision. After graphing the trends, we will examine which areas have a similar slope, and therefore could be used for comparison. We will repeat this process twice. First, we will compare year-long trends between the three test areas, and second, we will compare 6 month long trends in the test areas.

Research question: Do the Del Rio or Rio Grande Valley border patrol sectors have similar trends to the El Paso border patrol sector before May 2018, when metering was enacted in El Paso. 

1. First we gather the data from the Customs and Border Patrol website, and combine data sources to make the data sets we need
